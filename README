herp re-writes ethernet headers, thereby acting as a user space bridge.
Right now, herp works on switched networks and forwards any packets that
have been sent to the host from ARP spoofing.

In the future, herp will probably become a real, although slow, bridge.


EXPORTS

start() -> {ok, PID}
start(Device) -> {ok, PID}

    Types   Device = string()

    Device is the network interface name.


HOW TO USE IT

> herp:start(). % start up the bridge
> farp:start().
